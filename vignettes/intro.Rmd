# Motivations

The development of armadillo emerges from the desire to follow a simplified
approach towards R and C++ integration by building on top of 
[cpp11](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11), a ground up rewrite of C++
bindings to R with different design trade-offs and features. armadillo
aims at providing an additional layer to put the end-user focus on the
computation instead of configuration [@cpp11].

[Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/) is a linear algebra library for the
C++ language, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. It is
justified in the fact that C++, in its current form, is very valuable to address
bottlenecks that we find with interpreted languages such as R and Python but it
does not provide data structures nor functions for linear algebra
[@Sanderson2016].

[RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo) was first
published to CRAN in 2010, and it allows to use Armadillo via
[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp), a widely extended R package
to call C++ functions from R [@Eddelbuettel2014].

# Design choices

The design choices in armadillo are:

- Providing a simpler implementation that makes the library easier to
  understand, maintain, and extend, benefiting both current users and future
  contributors.
- Offering a completely header-only approach, eliminating Application Binary
  Interface compatibility issues and simplifying library integration and
  distribution.
- Facilitating vendoring, which allows for the inclusion of the library
  directly in projects, thus simplifying dependency management and distribution.

These ideas reflect a comprehensive effort to provide an efficient interface for
integrating C++ and R that aligns with the Tidy philosophy [@Wickham2019],
addressing both the technical and community-driven aspects that influence
software evolution.

These choices have advantages and disadvantages. A disadvantage is that
armadillo will not convert data types automatically, the user must be
explicit about data types, especially when passing data from R to C++ and then
exporting the final computation back to R. An advantage is that armadillo
codes, including its internal templates, can be adapted to work with Python
via [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
[@pybind11].

armadillo uses @Hansen2022 notation, meaning that matrices are column-major
and vectors are expressed as column vectors (i.e., $N\times1$ matrices).

# Examples

Convention: input R matrices are denoted by `x`, `y`, `z`, and output or
intermediate C++ matrices are denoted by `X`, `Y`, `Z`. The example functions can
be called from R scripts and should have proper headers as in the following
code:

```cpp
#include <armadillo.hpp>
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;

[[cpp11::register]] // allows using the function in R
doubles_matrix<> solve_mat(doubles_matrix<> x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(x); // convert from R to C++
  Mat<double> Yinv = inv(Y); // Y^(-1)
  return as_doubles_matrix(Yinv); // convert from C++ to R
}
```

This example includes the Armadillo, cpp11 and armadillo libraries, and
allows interfacing C++ with R (i.e., the `#include <cpp11.hpp>`). It also loads
the corresponding namespaces (i.e., the `using namespace cpp11`) in order to
simplify the notation (i.e., using `Mat` instead of `arma::Mat`).

The `as_Mat()` function is provided by armadillo to pass a `matrix` object
from R to C++ and that Armadillo can read.

The `as_doubles_matrix()` function is also provided by armadillo to pass a
`Mat<double>` or `Mat<int>` object from C++ to R.

## Ordinary Least Squares

Given a design matrix $X$ and and outcome vector $y$, one function to obtain the
OLS estimator $\hat{\beta} = (X^tX)^{-1}(X^tY)$ as a matrix (i.e., column
vector) is:

```cpp
Mat<double> ols_(const doubles_matrix<>& y, const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(y);  // Col<double> Y = as_Col(y); also works
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<double> XtX = X.t() * X;             // X'X
  Mat<double> XtX_inv = inv(XtX);          // (X'X)^(-1)
  Mat<double> beta = XtX_inv * X.t() * Y;  // (X'X)^(-1)(X'Y)

  return beta;
}

[[cpp11::register]] doubles_matrix<> ols_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& y,
                                             const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> beta = ols_(y, x);
  return as_doubles_matrix(beta);
}

[[cpp11::register]] doubles ols_dbl(const doubles_matrix<>& y,
                                    const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> beta = ols_(y, x);
  return as_doubles(beta);
}
```

The `ols_mat()` function receives inputs from R and calls `ols_()` to do the
computation on C++ side. The use of `const` and `&` are specific to the C++
language and allow to pass data from R to C++ while avoiding copying the data,
therefore saving time and memory.

The `ols_dbl()` function does the same but returns a vector instead of a matrix.

# Benchmarks

A proper benchmark is to compute eigenvalues for large matrices. Both
armadillo and RcppArmadillo use Armadillo as a backend, and the marginal
observed differences are because of how cpp11 and Rcpp pass data from R to C++
and viceversa. The computation times are identical.

|Input     | Median time armadillo | Median time RcppArmadillo |
|:---------|---------------------------:|--------------------------:|
|500x500   |                     35.07ms|                     36.4ms|
|1000x1000 |                    260.28ms|                   263.21ms|
|1500x1500 |                    874.62ms|                   857.31ms|
|2000x2000 |                       2.21s|                      2.21s|

|Input     | Memory allocation armadillo | Memory allocation RcppArmadillo |
|:---------|---------------------------------:|--------------------------------:|
|500x500   |                            17.1KB|                           4.62MB|
|1000x1000 |                              21KB|                           4.62MB|
|1500x1500 |                            24.9KB|                           4.63MB|
|2000x2000 |                            28.8KB|                           4.63MB|

The armadillo computation was obtained with the `eigen_sym_mat()` function
already shown.

The RcppArmadillo computation was obtained with the following function:

```cpp
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
arma::mat eigen_sym_mat(const arma::mat& x) {
  arma::mat y = eig_sym(x);
  return y;
}
```

In order to get the RcppArmadillo function to work, we had to dedicate time
to search online about the error `function 'enterRNGScope' not provided by
package 'Rcpp'`, which required to include `// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]`
for the function to work.

# Additional Examples

The package repository includes the directory `armadillotest`, which contains
an R package that uses Armadillo, and that provides additional examples
for eigenvalues, QR decomposition, and others.

# Conclusion

RcppArmadillo has been and will continue to be widely successful. armadillo
is a alternative templated implementation with different design trade-offs and
features. Both packages can co-exist and continue to enrich the R community.
