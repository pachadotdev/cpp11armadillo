Dear Editor and Reviewers,

I have addressed the following presentation changes:

- you have your name listed twice on the title page.  
Why not list your affiliation on a single line?
"Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"

- put the citations in numerical order (e.g [1], [2], ..) as specified by our journal guidelines

- the text beginning with "CHANGE .." on page 6 - is this correct?

- there are things that need to be capitalized in the references
(e.g, C++

- Burns ref ( r or R)?  is there a better reference or link - it seems incomplete

- 'R" Core  - the trailing quote is reversed and also in the title

- long dash with "2019" - something is missing and capitalize C++

- Vaugn - "c++" and "r's c" ?

Each of these is highlighted as a Git diff in the PDF with the changes.
