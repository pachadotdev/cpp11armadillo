Dear Professors Colubi, Kontoghiorghes and Park,

Please consider our article titled "cpp11armadillo: An R Package to Use the Armadillo C++ Library" for publication in Computational Statistics & Data Analysis.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `cpp11armadillo` which provides  provide a novel approach to use the Armadillo C++ library by using the header-only cpp11 R package, and an extended documentation that covers the common challenges that R users might encounter when using C++.

We believe the readers of Computational Statistics & Data Analysis will find this article helpful for their work because it shows how, when and why using the C++ language to solve bottlenecks and when users should vectorize their operations in R. We hope that it will be a valuable addition to the journal.

Regards,
