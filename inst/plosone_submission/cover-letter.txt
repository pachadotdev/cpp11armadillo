Dear PLOS ONE Editorial Team,

Please consider our article titled "cpp11armadillo: An R Package to Use the
Armadillo C++ Library" for publication in PLOS ONE.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `cpp11armadillo` which provides 
a novel approach to use the Armadillo C++ library by using the header-only cpp11
R package, and an extended documentation that covers the common challenges that
R users might encounter when using C++.

We believe your readers will find this article helpful for their work because it
shows how, when and why using the C++ language to solve bottlenecks and when
users should vectorize their operations in R. We hope that it will be a valuable
addition to the journal.

To prepare the manuscript, we used the Quarto system, which provides a PLOS ONE
template (https://github.com/quarto-journals/plos). We hope that it is ok,
because the manuscript includes plots that we are not sure how to put as
separate files when rendering the document and not include them in the document.
We have attached the figures as separate files in the submission.

Regards,
